## What is this?
An attempt at a tool to automate string translation synchronization between Android and Ios.

*The main idea:* When an iOS or an Android team requests translation and that translation is done, this translation will be syncronized between the two repos with a run of a command.

Currently the tool `wti pulls` the strings and makes a local copy and DOES NOT operate on the original files!

## Prerequisites
* `git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.neterra.paysafe.com:7999/mobile/androidskrillapp.git`
* `git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.neterra.paysafe.com:7999/mobile/iosskrillapp.git`
* globaly installed [wti tool](https://github.com/AtelierConvivialite/webtranslateit#installation)

>You'll need these repos so you can point the tool to the folder inside each repo pointing to the `.wti` file.

## How to run:
* `git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.neterra.paysafe.com:7999/~plamenpetkov/webtranslateit-tool.git`
* `cd webtranslateit-tool`
* `npm install`
* open `app/configuration.json` and set up your environment
* `node app/index.js`
* migrated string files are in the `pulled/(ios/android)` folder.

>Note: If you're going to copy paste directly to iOS strings folder, rename `zh` to `zh-Hans` first.

## Problems to think about:
*generic_key === english translaction*

* "wait let me take a selfie" *> different quotes on android and ios causes different generic_key
* same generic_key for different original keys *> will this be a problem when matching ios and android state
* case sensitive/insensitive *> is it a problem if we do case unsensitive for generic_keys
* we can have all strings and keys in both places and then clean unused resources bot in the xcode and android studio projects
  
 *simmlilar strings:*
